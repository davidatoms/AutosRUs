# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
Using statistics, hypothesis testing, and the R computer programming language, I analyzed a series of datasets from the automotive industry.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
- How to visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots ussing ggplot2.
- How to generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
- How to plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
- How to formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
- How to implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
- How to implement and evaulate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
- How to implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
- How to identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
- How to determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.
