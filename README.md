# AutosRUs
Using statistics, hypothesis testing, and the R computer programming language, I analyzed a series of datasets from the automotive industry.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
- How to visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots ussing ggplot2.
- How to generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
